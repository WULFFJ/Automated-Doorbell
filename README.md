# Automated-Doorbell
This is a python script, which accomplishes the following:

1. PIR sensor will detect someone walking up to the front door within about 12-15 feet
2. Once detected a "Gong" sound goes off
3. The first motion detection saves an image
4. The second motion detection sends an image to a Telegram channel where you get a picture of the person
5. A second greeting is played at random from a list of 10 selected greetings that are funny
6. When the button is pushed, it has a voice come on and say "we are fetching our master"
7. Telegram alert is sent once again.
8. Have a mumble server setup on the PI as well to talk and listen
